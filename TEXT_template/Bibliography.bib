title="Simple statistical gradient-following algorithms for connectionist reinforcement learning",
journal="Machine Learning",
year="1992",
volume="8",
number="3",
pages="229--256",
abstract="This article presents a general class of associative reinforcement learning algorithms for connectionist networks containing stochastic units. These algorithms, called REINFORCE algorithms, are shown to make weight adjustments in a direction that lies along the gradient of expected reinforcement in both immediate-reinforcement tasks and certain limited forms of delayed-reinforcement tasks, and they do this without explicitly computing gradient estimates or even storing information from which such estimates could be computed. Specific examples of such algorithms are presented, some of which bear a close relationship to certain existing algorithms while others are novel but potentially interesting in their own right. Also given are results that show how such algorithms can be naturally integrated with backpropagation. We close with a brief discussion of a number of additional issues surrounding the use of such algorithms, including what is known about their limiting behaviors as well as further considerations that might be used to help develop similar but potentially more powerful reinforcement learning algorithms.",

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a study of the policy improvement step that can be usefully exploited by approximate policy-iteration algorithms. When either the policy evaluation step or the policy improvement step returns an approximated result, the sequence of policies produced by policy iteration may not be monotonically increasing, and oscillations may occur. To address this issue, we consider safe policy improvements, i.e., at each iteration we search for a policy that maximizes a lower bound to the policy improvement w.r.t. the current policy. When no improving policy can be found the algorithm stops. We propose two safe policy-iteration algorithms that differ in the way the next policy is chosen w.r.t. the estimated greedy policy. Besides being theoretically derived and discussed, the proposed algorithms are empirically evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art approaches on some chain-walk domains and on the Blackjack card game.},

  Abstract                 = {{Modified policy iteration (MPI) is a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that contains the two celebrated policy and value iteration methods. Despite its generality, MPI has not been thoroughly studied, especially its approximation form which is used when the state and/or action spaces are large or infinite. In this paper, we propose three implementations of approximate MPI (AMPI) that are extensions of well-known approximate DP algorithms: fitted-value iteration, fitted-Q iteration, and classification-based policy iteration. We provide error propagation analysis that unifies those for approximate policy and value iteration. For the classification-based implementation, we develop a finite-sample analysis that shows that MPI's main parameter allows to control the balance between the estimation error of the classifier and the overall value function approximation.}},

  Abstract                 = {{In multi-objective optimization, the knowledge of the Pareto set provides valuable information on the reachable optimal performance. A number of evolutionary strategies (PAES [4], NSGA-II [3], etc), have been proposed in the literature and proved to be successful to identify the Pareto set. However, these derivative-free algorithms are very demanding in computational time. Today, in many areas of computational sciences, codes are developed that include the calculation of the gradient, cautiously validated and calibrated. Thus, an alternate method applicable when the gradients are known is introduced presently. Using a clever combination of the gradients, a descent direction common to all criteria is identified. As a natural outcome, the Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) is defined as a generalization of the steepest-descent method and compared with PAES by numerical experiments. Using MGDA on a multi objective optimization problem requires the evaluation of a large number of points with regard to criteria, and their gradients. In the particular case of CFD problems, each point evaluation is very costly. Thus here we also propose to construct metamodels and to calculate approximate gradients by local finite differences.}},
